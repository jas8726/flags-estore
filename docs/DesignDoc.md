## Executive Summary

This project involves a backend and frontend implementation of a flag E-store, where users can purchase 
and customize flags and the owner can add new flags to their inventory. The backend, titled Flags_API, uses 
model, controller, and persistence tier structure to implement the workings on the E-store. In these tiers are classes
that implement the inventory and deal with flag objects. The entire backend is written in java. The frontend, titled 
Tour-of-Flags, utilizes angular and maven to create the connection to the backend and implement the site interface. It 
utilizes component and service structure by maven. The frontend is written in Typescript, HTML, and Cascading Style Sheets. 

### Purpose
> _Provide a very brief statement about the project and the most
> important user group and user goals._

### Glossary and Acronyms
> _Provide a table of terms and acronyms._

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| TS | Typescript |
| CSS | Cascading Style Sheets |


## Requirements

This section describes the features of the application.

> _In this section you do not need to be exhaustive and list every
> story.  Focus on top-level features from the Vision document and
> maybe Epics and critical Stories._

### Definition of MVP
> _Provide a simple description of the Minimum Viable Product._

### MVP Features
> _Provide a list of top-level Epics and/or Stories of the MVP._

### Roadmap of Enhancements
> _Provide a list of top-level features in the order you plan to consider them._


## Application Domain

The domain model starts with the user. The user interacts with the server and can login as either the admin of
the E-store or a customer. The server stores the products in the inventory of the E-store, which in our project 
are flags. The admin can edit this inventory, adding or removing products as desired. The customer can search 
through the products in the inventory. The customer also has a shopping cart that they can add products from 
inventory to or remove products from. They can purchase products from the shopping cart through checkout.

## Architecture and Design

This section describes the application architecture.

### Summary

The following Tiers/Layers model shows a high-level view of the webapp's architecture.

![The Tiers & Layers of the Architecture](architecture-tiers-and-layers.png)

The e-store web application, is built using the Model–View–ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern. 

The Model stores the application data objects including any functionality to provide persistance. 

The View is the client-side SPA built with Angular utilizing HTML, CSS and TypeScript. The ViewModel provides RESTful APIs to the client (View) as well as any logic required to manipulate the data objects from the Model.

Both the ViewModel and Model are built using Java and Spring Framework. Details of the components within these tiers are supplied below.


### Overview of User Interface

This section describes the web interface flow; this is how the user views and interacts
with the e-store application.

> _Provide a summary of the application's user interface.  Describe, from
> the user's perspective, the flow of the pages in the web application._


### View Tier
> _Provide a summary of the View Tier UI of your architecture.
> Describe the types of components in the tier and describe their
> responsibilities.  This should be a narrative description, i.e. it has
> a flow or "story line" that the reader can follow._

> _You must also provide sequence diagrams as is relevant to a particular aspects 
> of the design that you are describing.  For example, in e-store you might create a 
> sequence diagram of a customer searching for an item and adding to their cart. 
> Be sure to include an relevant HTTP reuqests from the client-side to the server-side 
> to help illustrate the end-to-end flow._


### ViewModel Tier
> _Provide a summary of this tier of your architecture. This
> section will follow the same instructions that are given for the View
> Tier above._

> _At appropriate places as part of this narrative provide one or more
> static models (UML class diagrams) with some details such as critical attributes and methods._


### Model Tier
> _Provide a summary of this tier of your architecture. This
> section will follow the same instructions that are given for the View
> Tier above._

> _At appropriate places as part of this narrative provide one or more
> static models (UML class diagrams) with some details such as critical attributes and methods._

### Static Code Analysis/Design Improvements
> _Discuss design improvements that you would make if the project were
> to continue. These improvement should be based on your direct
> analysis of where there are problems in the code base which could be
> addressed with design changes, and describe those suggested design
> improvements._

> _With the results from the Static Code Analysis exercise, 
> discuss the resulting issues/metrics measurements along with your analysis
> and recommendations for further improvements. Where relevant, include 
> screenshots from the tool and/or corresponding source code that was flagged._

## Testing
> _This section will provide information about the testing performed
> and the results of the testing._

### Acceptance Testing
> _Report on the number of user stories that have passed all their
> acceptance criteria tests, the number that have some acceptance
> criteria tests failing, and the number of user stories that
> have not had any testing yet. Highlight the issues found during
> acceptance testing and if there are any concerns._

### Unit Testing and Code Coverage
> _Discuss your unit testing strategy. Report on the code coverage
> achieved from unit testing of the code base. Discuss the team's
> coverage targets, why you selected those values, and how well your
> code coverage met your targets. If there are any anomalies, discuss
> those._
